## Who are we?

Here at Unlocked, we're aiming to build a component library to help you build a product and design system for the future. You can find out more about our mission at our official website.

This documentation covers everything from installation to implementation. If you have any issues or recognise any obvious areas, the documentation GitHub is open-source and eager to bring on new members to our community!

## How to contribute

Unlocked hopes to become a self-sustaining community of developers and designers. If you wish to become a maintainer, we will soon be providing a contribution handbook and guide.

## Raising an issue

We're looking at ways to make sure this process is as smooth as possible.

For now, please raise issues on our GitHub repository and ensure that the issue conforms to our [issue report format]('/community/bug-report'). Issues that don't conform to this will be closed to help smooth out our development processes.
